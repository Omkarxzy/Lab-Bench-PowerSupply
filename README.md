# Lab-Bench-PowerSupply
Salvaged an old SMPS (switching mode power supply) from a CPU to
create a lab bench power supply. Added a variable voltage output
using an LM317 voltage regulator. Additionally, integrated a display 
to provide real-time feedback on the current output voltage and
current being drawn by the connected device, enhancing usability 
and safety during operation.

I created this PowerSuppy by refrencing youtube tutorial by dronebot Workshop channel
link :- " www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_A-jkpjpcM " and added other features I required.
